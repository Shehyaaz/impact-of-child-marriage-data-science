Topic : Impact of child marriage on child under-nutrition

Tools used :
1. R programming language (R 4.1)
2. RStudio
NOTE: No additional R packages were installed in the code

Steps to execute:
1. Execute script.R either from RStudio, or from command prompt

Explanation of the code:
Step-1: Determination of child under-nutrition status :-
	- WHO growth standards were used for the determination. (link : https://www.who.int/tools/child-growth-standards)
	- Low weight-for-height is known as wasting.
	- Low height-for-age is known as stunting.
	- Children with low weight-for-age are known as underweight.
	- An infant was defined as stunted, wasted or underweight if his or her length-for-age, weight-for-length or weight-for-age z-score, respectively, was less than -2.
	- The z-score was accessed from the WHO growth standards to determine the under-nutrition status of the child. Specifically, for determining stunting, 
	  the -2 SD of the corresponding age was retrieved from the appropriate WHO dataset and the height of the child was compared to the retrieved value.
	  If the height is less than the retrieved value, the child is stunted. Similarly, wasted and underweight status were determined.
	- A child is under-nutritioned if he/she is either stunted, wasted, underweight or any combination of stunted, wasted and underweight.
Step-2: Assessing the impact of the factors from the provided dataset on child under-nutrition :-
	- Logistic regression models (or binary regression models) were constructed to assess the impact of the factors from the provided dataset on
	  child under-nutrition status. Specifically, logistic regression models of child under-nutrition against the factors, child stunting against the factors,
	  child wasting against the factors and child underweight against the factors were constructed.
	- The summary of the above models is stored in result/model-data.txt
	- Barplots of the data is stored in the "result" folder.
